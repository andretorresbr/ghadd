function Sync-ADObjectToGroup {
<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Synchronizes a target Active Directory group with the users or computers from one or more specified OUs.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function ensures that a destination group contains exactly the objects found within
        one or more source Organizational Units (OUs), including their sub-OUs. Objects in the group that are not in any of the
        source OUs are removed, and objects from the source OUs not in the group are added.
        It has an optional parameter to exclude specific objects from being synchronized.

    .PARAMETER SourceOU
        The distinguished name or path of the Organizational Unit (OU) or an array of OUs to search for objects.
        The search is performed recursively on all sub-OUs.

    .PARAMETER DestinationGroup
        The name of the Active Directory group to be synchronized.

    .PARAMETER ObjectType
        Specifies the type of objects to synchronize. Valid values are 'User' or 'Computer'.

    .PARAMETER ExcludedObject
        An optional parameter to specify one or more objects (by their name) to be excluded from being
        added or removed from the group. This can be a single string or an array of strings.

    .PARAMETER LogFile
        The full path to the log file where all command output will be written. This is a mandatory parameter.
		
    .EXAMPLE
        Sync-ADObjectToGroup -SourceOU "OU=Tier0,DC=corp,DC=local" -DestinationGroup "T0 Servers" -ObjectType Computer

        This command synchronizes the 'T0 Servers' group to contain exactly the computer objects from the 'Tier0' OU and its sub-OUs.

    .EXAMPLE
        Sync-ADObjectToGroup -SourceOU @("OU=Tier0,DC=corp,DC=local", "OU=Domain Controllers,DC=corp,DC=local") -DestinationGroup "T0 Servers" -ObjectType Computer -LogFile "C:\Tools\Scripts\Sync-T0_Servers_log.txt"

        This command synchronizes the 'T0 Servers' group with computer objects found in both the 'Tier0' and 'Tier1' OUs.

    .EXAMPLE
        Sync-ADObjectToGroup -SourceOU "OU=Usuarios,OU=Tier0,DC=corp,DC=local" -DestinationGroup "T0 Users" -ObjectType User -ExcludedObject @("breaktheglass_da","btg_da") -LogFile "C:\Tools\Scripts\Sync-T0_Users_log.txt"

        This command synchronizes the 'T0 Users' group with user objects from the 'Usuarios/Tier0' OU, excluding the users with the name 'breaktheglass_da' and 'btg_da'.
